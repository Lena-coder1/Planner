## 1. Problem Statement

With the amount of courses an average student takes every semester, it can be difficult to keep up with assignments, projects, labs, etc.. This study planner is designed to help students stay on top of their to-do lists and manage assignments by breaking them down into smaller tasks. The planner will allow students to keep track of important dates and modify tasks as needed.

## 2. Project Description

This project aims to create a study planner that helps students manage their academic workload. The program will feature a main menu with several options for user interaction.

## 3. Features

The study planner will include the following functionalities:

* **Add a Task:** Users will be able to add a new task to their planner. They will be prompted to provide a `taskName`, `taskInfo`, and `dueDate`.
* **Modify a Task:** Users can select an existing task from a displayed list and choose to modify specific fields, such as the `taskName`, `taskInfo`, or `dueDate`.
* **Remove a Completed Task:** Users can view the list of tasks and select one to remove from the planner.
* **Exit:** Users have the option to exit the program. Upon exiting, a farewell message will be displayed.
